	<p>These are the Terms and Conditions governing the use of this Service and the agreement that operates between You

		the Service.</p>
	<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on Your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms and

	<h2 id="clientservice">Client Service</h2>
	<p>The Company will make all reasonable effort to meet any agreed-to milestone and/or phase timelines. All
		milestones are an approximation depending on many factors, some of which will be outside the Company's
		reasonable control. These factors may include not having a clear person of contact (PoC); therefore, the Company
		shall have a Client-appointed authority-having figure with whom the Company is able to make speedy contact and
		correspondence.This PoC shall also assist the Developer in defining Software requirements, as described in
		#Specification.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>The Client's assigned person of contact may not always be available for feedback and demonstration sessions due
		to circumstances outside their control. In this case, milestones and phases may be pushed back to a reasonable
		extent if the quality of the product will degrade otherwise. The Company will make all reasonable effort to keep
		project milestones on track.</p>
	<p>For initial iterations of PEAK, access to necessary data and relevant devices will hasten the Company's time to
		devlop. As such, the Company requests a hosted server and VPN access to the Client's network on their Company
		workstations be provided for the duration of the contract term.</p>
	<h2 id="clientsduties">Client's duties</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Personnel Access</strong>&nbsp;The Client shall provide reasonable access to engineers for feedback
			on desired software functionality and features, prototype design and approval, MVP testing, feedback and
			approval - as described in #Specification, Phase 1, and written notice of its finding that the Software
			conforms to the Specifications within 14 calendar days of the Delivery Date (the "AcceptanceDate") unless it
			finds that the Software does not conform to the Specifications as described in the Proposal and again in
			#Specification. If the Software as delivered does not conform with the Specifications, the Client shall
			within 14 calendar days of the Delivery Date notify the Developer in writing of the ways on which it does
			not conform with the Specifications. The Developer agrees that upon receiving such notice, it shall make
			reasonable efforts to correct any non-conformity.</li>
		<li><strong>Additional Access</strong>&nbsp;Additionally, the Software shall require on site and remote access
			to any intended target networks, databases, servers, target distribution machines, cloud resources, network
			resources, target hardware, target operating systems, hosting services, and more of the like, if deemed
			necessary by the Client. To affect such access, the Client shall provide access, such as VPN, network,
			software, et al, on Developer's development machines to ensure timely delivery of Deliverables. Server
			resources shall also be allocated to run production ready software containers for maximal uptime
			capabilities.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="compensation">Compensation</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>The Software</strong>&nbsp;In consideration for the Service, the Client shall pay the Developer 20%
			down,with additional installments invoiced upon phase completion - defined in greater detail in
			#Specification where the final 50% shall be invoiced upon the Acceptance Date. More details regarding
			specifics of payment for the Service, see #Delivery Payment Schedule. Developer shall provide the Client
			with an invoice. Invoices will be provided for work completed by the developer on net 30 terms.</li>
		<li><strong>Materials</strong>&nbsp;In consideration for materials required, Developer shall notify Client of
			requirements as needed per stage of development, providing various purchase options and pros and cons of
			each. Examples of such requirements may include SAAS, such as web hosting, secure version control,
			distribute resources, or hardware requirements, such as various OS integrations for testing, sensors,
			buttons, displays, et al. as defined in Phase 1 requirements drafting activity. Developer shall endeavor to
			give timely notice to give Client adequate time to acquire materials. Any delay in acquisition may result in
			delay in deliverable timeframes.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	<h2 id="intellectualpropertyrightsnbsp">Intellectual property rights&nbsp;</h2>
	<p>The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Client will hold all intellectual property rights in the Software
		including, but not limited to, copyright and trademark rights. The Developer agrees not to claim any such
		ownership in the Software's intellectual property at any time prior to or after the completion and delivery of
		the Software to the Client.Additionally, the Parties acknowledge no claim may be made on 3rd party,open source,
		or background software developed under permissive licensing. Some software shall be derived of the Developer's
		own software packages. Developer shall maintain all rights to these packages, where Client shall be granted a
		non exclusive, royalty free, worldwide, perpetual and irrevocable license, including the right to make, have
		made, sell, use, reproduce, modify, adapt, display, distribute, make other versions of and disclose the property
		and to sublicense others to do these things as they see fit. The Developer retains the right to display graphics
		and other design elements as examples of its work in its portfolio.</p>
	<h2 id="changeinspecifications">Change in specifications</h2>
	<p>The Client may request that reasonable changes be made to the Specifications and tasks associated with the
		implementation of the Specifications. If the Client requests such a change, the Developer will use its best
		efforts to implement the requested change at no additional expense to the Client and without delaying delivery
		of the Software.</p>
	<p>In the event that the proposed change will, in the sole discretion of the Developer, require a delay in the
		delivery of the Software or would result in additional expense to the Client, then the Client and the Developer
		shall confer and the Client may either withdraw the proposed change or require the Developer to deliver the
		Software with the proposed change and subject to the delay and/or additional expense. The Client agrees and
		acknowledges that the judgment as to if there will be any delay or additional expense shall be made solely by
		the Developer.</p>
	<h2 id="forcemajeure">Force majeure</h2>

		even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy
		fails of its essential purpose.</p>
	<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or
		consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each
		party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

		statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But
