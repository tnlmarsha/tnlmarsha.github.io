Please read Our Privacy Policy carefully before using Our Service.</p>
<h1 id="client-services">Client Services</h1>
<p>The Company will make all reasonable effort to meet any agreed-to milestone and/or phase timelines. All milestones are an approximation depending on many factors, some of which will be outside the Company's reasonable control. These factors may include not having a clear person of contact; therefore, the Company shall have a Client-appointed authority-having figure with whom the Company is able to make speedy contact and correspondence.</p>
<p>The Client's assigned person of contact may not always be available for feedback and demonstration sessions due to circumstances outside their control. In this case, milestones and phases may be pushed back to a reasonable extent if the quality of the product will degrade otherwise. The Company will make all reasonable effort to keep project milestones on track.</p>
<p>For initial iterations of PEAK, access to necessary data and relevant devices will hasten the Comnpany's time to devlop. As such, the Company requests a hosted server and VPN access to the Client's network on their Company workstations be provided for the duration of the contract term.</p>
<h1 id="links-to-other-websites">Links to Other Websites</h1>
<p>Our Service may contain links to third-party web sites or services that are not owned or controlled by the Company.</p>
<p>The Company has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>
<p>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party web sites or services that You visit.</p>

<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
<h1 id="%22as-is%22-and-%22as-available%22-disclaimer">&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h1>

To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law.</p>
<h1 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h1>
<p>The laws of the Country, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>

<h2 id="waiver">Waiver</h2>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<h1 id="translation-interpretation">Translation Interpretation</h1>
<p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them available to You on our Service.
You agree that the original English text shall prevail in the case of a dispute.</p>
